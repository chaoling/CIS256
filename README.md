# Instructions  

#### The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89`, . . . where every number (after the first two 1â€™s) is the sum of the previous two numbers (for example, `34 = 21 + 13`). The numbers are counted starting with the first 1, so that, for example, the 7th Fibonacci number is 13. 

Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer `n` and then outputs the sum of first n Fibonacci numbers. For example, if the user enters `10`, the program would output:
```
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,
sum of first 10 fib number is: 143
```
