### Overview
Sudoku puzzles are the most popular form of number game that we have been playing since our childhood. In fact, it is a simple puzzle, with a simple design and simple rules without any hindrances. However, children and adults of all ages cannot help but fall in love with its challenges. In this project, we will develop a Sudoku game in Python. Let’s start!!!

### What is the Sudoku Game?
The Sudoku puzzle game is played on a 9 x 9 grid. Within the rows and columns are 9 boxes which are made up of 3 x 3 space. The purpose of the puzzle is to enter a digit number from 1 to 9 in each row & a 9 × 9 grid column without duplicating any numbers between the row, column or box.

In the stater code, we provided some helper functions to setup the game, you task is to implement the key algorithms in this game:

1) `isAllowed(self, number, coord)`: given a number and its intended coordinate in the 9x9 grid, return if this move is allowed
2) `solve(self)`: given an initial sudoku board, try solve it using DFS and back tracking
